# 🏡 California Housing Prices — Linear Regression (LunarTech Case Study)

This repository contains my end-to-end Linear Regression project on the California Housing Prices dataset.  
Built as part of the **LunarTech Machine Learning Case Study**, this notebook helped me practice real-world data cleaning, EDA, model building, and evaluation.

## 📊 Project Overview

- **Goal:** Predict median house prices in California districts using features like median income, population, and location.
- **Dataset:** [California Housing Prices](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/datasets/real_world.html#california-housing-dataset) (from Scikit-Learn)
- **Course:** LunarTech Machine Learning Bootcamp

## ⚙️ Workflow

1. **Data Loading**
   - Loaded the dataset directly via Scikit-Learn.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Checked for missing values and outliers.
   - Visualized feature distributions, correlations, and key trends.

3. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Imputed missing values.
   - Feature scaling and encoding as needed.
   - Performed a train/test split.

4. **Model Building**
   - Trained a Linear Regression model with Scikit-Learn.
   - Evaluated performance using RMSE and R² metrics.

5. **Results**
   - **R² Score:** 0.588
   - **RMSE:** 59405
